    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "### 1.  Random Forest Classifier\n",
    "- This model has been used in analysing and classifying urban space for use for particular activities: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6567884/\n",
    "- The strengths of this model is that it is easy to use, it works well when implemented as an ensemble method, and it avoids the overfitting of the standalone Decision tree model by incorporating randomness and being implemented in ensemble. It also deals well with unbalanced data sets and can take in both categorical and numerical data\n",
    "- The weaknesses of this model is that it is not very good for predictions as it produces a discrete classification, and it can overfit if given very noisy data https://blog.citizennet.com/blog/2012/11/10/random-forests-ensembles-and-performance-metrics#:~:text=Random%20Forest%20weaknesses%20are%20that,upon%20your%20own%20data%20set.\n",
    "- This model is good for our data because we are performing a binaristic classification problem, and Random Forests perform well in such problems and with categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. AdaBoost Classifier\n",
    "- This model is used often for image recognition: https://sefiks.com/2018/11/02/a-step-by-step-adaboost-example/, http://acta.uni-obuda.hu/Markoski_Ivankovic_Ratgeber_Pecev_Glusac_57.pdf\n",
    "- The strengths of this model are that it is flexible and can be used for many different kinds of classifications. Also, it is fast and easy to implement and does not need many parameter settings in order to work effectively. \n",
    "- The weaknesses of this model are that it is sensitive to outliers in data and noisy data, and so is sensitive to whether data has been pre-processed or not. \n",
    "- AdaBoost is useful here because it works fast and effectively in categorisation problems with large datasets, and deals well with binaristic classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Support Vector Machines\n",
    "- SVMs are used widely in life sciences models and predictions, especially in telling whether one state exists or not, see: https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-60327-241-4_13#citeas (examples: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1012487302797 https://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/24/22/5574.abstract; https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/16/10/906/223564)\n",
    "- The strengths of this classifier include that it works well when there is a relatively high margin of separation and, when this is the case, overfitting is less likely. They are very useful in prediction as they can provide highly accurate separations of data. Also, they work well with high dimensionality in data and are not very susceptible to the influence of outliers (https://iq.opengenus.org/advantages-of-svm/)\n",
    "- The weaknesses of SVM methods include that it requires more parameters as input than other methods such as AdaBoost, and it can be highly susceptible to noise. Its performance on very large datasets is also not always very good, but can also easily underperform when there are insufficient training data samples https://dhirajkumarblog.medium.com/top-4-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-support-vector-machine-or-svm-a3c06a2b107#:~:text=SVM%20works%20relatively%20well%20when,than%20the%20number%20of%20samples.\n",
    "- SVM is useful here because we want accurate predictions, and we can modify the kernel used to find better fits to classify our data. It is also useful as a foil for the other two data classifiers, to check out different performances. "

When we look at the testing data, however, AdaBoost model consistently has the highest F-Score and accuracy for the increments of testing data, even though its does take significantly longer than any of the other two models. In light of this, the best model may be the Linear SVC Model, which is the 'middle best' throughout both sets of data, and consistently takes the low amounts of time to execute in the testing set. However, if the data set is very large, it would be better to use the AdaBoost model, as this can handle large amounts of data and it perfomed best in terms of accuracy and F-score on the testing data, although it was slower comparatively."

    "I identified three of the five most relevant features. This confirms my thoughts about age, number of years in education and capital gain, though not in the order I had put them. I had thought that both education and capital gain were more important than age, but the actual ordering is the reverse to my listing. Clearly age is of greater importance, and capital gain is a more significant predictor than number of years in education. \n",
    "\n",
    "Features that I did not think would be as important are capital loss and hours per week. It is clear that people who can engage in capital 'trades', and therefore who would actually be exposed to levels of capital loss, are much more likely to be high-earning individuals, and so it makes sense that this is an important predictor. I had not thought that hours per week would be quite as influential as they are, as I presumed that, after a certain level of income, actual number of hours worked counts much less than the occupation itself, but I can see that perhaps what is happpening is that type of occupation levels out after a certain amount of experience, and the amount of hours worked becomes more important.."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "The final model on reduced data differs from the full data score by ~3% on accuracy, and around ~6% in the f-scores. These are not huge, but can be significant if the nonprofit concerned really wants to minimise resources spent on reaching out to people, as this number could turn into quite a lot of people if selected from a particularly large set. If time were a factor, I might consider using instead the LinearSVC model or the Random Forest model and checking their final scores in comparison to these, as they both work faster than AdaBoost and might be able to provide good results on the full data set in the same time as AdaBoost on the reduced set. But then again, the precision given by AdaBoost is useful, and we might only achieve with other methods the same precision as AdaBoost does on the reduced set. So, because these scores are around 5%, I would be comfortable using the AdaBoost method if time were a factor, as these amounts are significant but not too much to completely derail the campaign. "
